# Linear-Regression
Linear Regression using Python


In this project, we will learn how to implement Linear Regression using Python and Numpy. Linear Regression is an important, fundamental concept if you want break into Machine Learning and Deep Learning. 

__Data Source:__ Refer to notebook.

### Below are the key objectives of this project:
1.	Create a linear model, and implement gradient descent.
2.	Train the linear model to fit given data with gradient descent.

### Below is the summary of the tasks performed in this project:
